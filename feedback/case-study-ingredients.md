title: Case study: Identifying a content gap with page feedback
---

In December 2020, when Health Canada approved the first COVID vaccine, they added the page feedback tool at the bottom of the vaccine content pages. The feedback highlighted a content gap that they wouldn’t have identified through analytics alone.

## Problem to solve

Between December 11 and 14, 2020, 60% (87/144) of comments on the [Pfizer-BioNTech “What you should know”](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/drugs-vaccines-treatments/vaccines/pfizer-biontech.html) page were about ingredients and allergies.

> “I wanted to know the ingredients because I have an allergy and want to get the shot.”

> “where is the list of ingredients??”

## What they did

Seeing this user need in the data, Health Canada quickly added an ingredient list to the page.

## Outcomes

Feedback about ingredients on the Pfizer-BioNTech “What you should know” page went from 35 comments on December 13 to 2 on the day after adding the ingredient list.

The link to ingredients from the "On this page" navigation became the second most used link on the page after the addition.
