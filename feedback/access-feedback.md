## Where feedback is stored

When a user submits a comment, it is sent and stored in a database managed by the Digital Transformation Office at TBS.

## How to access feedback

Feedback can be viewed and downloaded as CSV or Excel files at any time using the Feedback Viewer website.

The Feedback Viewer is a password protected environment available to all page feedback participants. Contact the DTO to access to the site.

Email: [{{ site.emails.dto }}](mailto:{{ site.emails.dto }})

## How long feedback is kept

The Feedback Viewer only stores six months of comments from the Page Feedback Tool.

Comments are deleted in the first week of each quarter.

<table class="provisional gc-table table" id="myTable1">
	<caption>Comment deletion schedule</caption>

			<th>Quarter</th>
