## Why collect user feedback

The primary purpose of collecting feedback is to use it as a **research tool** to improve content.

> Client feedback is a critical input into ensuring that services meet the needs of clients and to support continual improvement.

First person feedback captured “in the moment” of failure gives us a lens into the issues affecting a page of content, task or service.

Combining feedback insights with other quantitative data is an important step towards building a service culture that is human-centred and evidence-driven to continuously improve our services in a timely manner for Canadians.

## Feedback tool design

The feedback tool is an **optional** pattern. It can be added to the bottom of a content page after the page content and before the date modified. It replaces the “Report a problem” pattern while actively collecting user feedback.

The feedback tool invites visitors to:

* indicate if they found what they were looking for (yes / no)
* offer their feedback describing the problem

## Protecting personal information

Filters are in place to remove these common types of personal information and profanity if submitted:

* phone numbers
* email addresses
* social insurance numbers
* passport numbers
* postal codes
* curse words

When personal information is automatically scrubbed, it is replaced with hashtags (###).

When profane words are removed, they are replaced with asterisks (\*\*\*).
