## OBuilding a narrative with data

Communicating insights for action requires:

*   a strong advocate for tasks and user needs
*   the ability to make sense of feedback and compare it with other data points
*   data visualization and communications skills when sharing and discuss findings

### Bring the user experience into the forefront

Through your feedback analysis, you want to help people understand:

*   context (volume, key dates, trends, why (you think) something is happening)
*   the issues people are reporting
*   possible paths to action or where additional data and research is needed
*   before and after results from iterative improvements

ALWAYS include feedback examples to illustrate key points and issues. This helps to transfer your understanding and empathetic listening to others.

### Include other supporting data sources

Include other data sources in your **analysis and reporting** to build a more complete picture, confirm your insights, or add urgency from sources such as:

*   results from the GC Task Success Survey
*   page feedback
*   analytics
*   call centre volumes
*   search trends
*   usability study results
*   questions received through social media

## Outline for a text only summary

A simple text only summary can be just as effective as charts or graphs when:

*   sharing insights by message or email - especially with decision makers
*   you have a small number of insights to communicate
*   your audience is already familiar with how and where feedback is being collected

### Example structure for a text only summary

*   Total feedback received
*   Pages that received the most feedback
*   Changes in trends
*   Priority areas: Top issues seen in feedback (illustrated with select feedback examples)

  *   What pages are those issues found on
  *   Supporting data from call centres, web analytics, search, usability studies, or other sources

*   What’s working well? Results based on iterative improvements
*   Recommendations for quick fixes

Highlight problems that go beyond the scope of your team’s work and need to be escalated - such as:

*   policy gaps
*   content gaps / incorrect information that require a subject matter expert
*   technical issues

## OTemplates for slides and charts

Charts can help illustrate trends, spot anomalies, confirm or explore research questions in the feedback.

A good chart is:

*   simple (opt for bar and line charts over pie charts)
*   easy to read, clearly labelled
*   supports your main point
*   works for the people who will read it

Aim for an assertion / evidence format in your titles

*   Put the main point for each slide or section of your document as the header.
*   Use the rest of the space to provide evidence for your assertion.
*   Even if someone only reads the headers, they’ll understand the main feedback issues.

## Showing before and after results

Share small and big wins with your results.

*   How interventions improved the user experience
*   Reduction in page feedback
*   How quickly you went from identifying a problem to addressing it
*   Impact on other channels (example: reduced call or email volumes)

### Supporting evidence to consider including:

*   Screenshots
*   Analytics visits, specific page actions, click overlays
*   Supporting data from other channels or data sources
