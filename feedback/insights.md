## Building a narrative with data

Communicating insights for action requires:

* a strong advocate for tasks and user needs
* the ability to make sense of feedback and compare it with other data points
* data visualization and communications skills when sharing and discuss findings

### Bring the user experience into the forefront

Through your feedback analysis, you want to help people understand:

* context (volume, key dates, trends, why (you think) something is happening)
* the issues people are reporting
* possible paths to action or where additional data and research is needed
* before and after results from iterative improvements

<span class="text-uppercase">Always</span> include feedback examples to illustrate key points and issues. This helps to transfer your understanding and empathetic listening to others.

### Include other supporting data sources

Include other data sources in your **analysis and reporting** to build a more complete picture, confirm your insights, or add urgency from sources such as:

* results from the GC Task Success Survey
* page feedback
* analytics
* call centre volumes
* search trends
* usability study results
* questions received through social media

## Outline for a text only summary

A simple text only summary can be just as effective as charts or graphs when:

* sharing insights by message or email - especially with decision makers
* you have a small number of insights to communicate
* your audience is already familiar with how and where feedback is being collected

### Example structure for a text only summary

* Total feedback received
* Pages that received the most feedback
* Changes in trends
* Priority areas: Top issues seen in feedback (illustrated with select feedback examples)

  * What pages are those issues found on
  * Supporting data from call centres, web analytics, search, usability studies, or other sources

* What’s working well? Results based on iterative improvements
* Recommendations for quick fixes

Highlight problems that go beyond the scope of your team’s work and need to be escalated - such as:

* policy gaps
* content gaps / incorrect information that require a subject matter expert
* technical issues

## Templates for slides and charts

Charts can help illustrate trends, spot anomalies, confirm or explore research questions in the feedback.

A good chart is:

* simple (opt for bar and line charts over pie charts)
* easy to read, clearly labelled
* supports your main point
* works for the people who will read it

Aim for an assertion / evidence format in your titles

* Put the main point for each slide or section of your document as the header.
* Use the rest of the space to provide evidence for your assertion.
* Even if someone only reads the headers, they’ll understand the main feedback issues.

## Showing before and after results

Share small and big wins with your results.

* How interventions improved the user experience
* Reduction in page feedback
* How quickly you went from identifying a problem to addressing it
* Impact on other channels (example: reduced call or email volumes)

### Supporting evidence to consider including:

* Screenshots
* Analytics visits, specific page actions, click overlays
* Supporting data from other channels or data sources
