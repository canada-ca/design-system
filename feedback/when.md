## Use cases for the page feedback tool

Consider adding the page feedback tool to:

*   uncover specific page-level issues affecting you GC Task Success Survey task score
*   understand content issues on pages you will be working on in the future
*   understand if new or existing pages are meeting user needs
*   identify emerging issues
*   monitor after page improvements have gone live

We recommend using the feedback tool where there is a commitment to reading and acting on input:

*   on specific pages; and
*   for a defined period of time

## Expectation and commitment

It is important to commit to reading, considering, and taking action based on what is submitted through feedback. Without this commitment, we are wasting peoples’ time.

In certain cases, people will leave feedback with their opinions of a certain program or policy. Addressing a policy issue is beyond the scope of web teams, so it's important to share these comments with program and policy colleagues.

## How not to use the feedback tool

The feedback tool should not be used for the following purposes:

### Evaluating page success based on yes / no clicks

The feedback tool is biased towards collecting ‘no’ answers in several ways:

*   Humans, by nature, have a negativity bias
*   We are only collecting feedback is someone selects ‘no’
*   If they did find an answer and were successful, they may never have reached the bottom of the page

### Evaluating statistical significance of feedback based on page visits

The number of page visits does not represent the number of people who saw the feedback tool at the bottom of the page or were motivated to use it

### Monitoring of public perceptions

Monitoring public perceptions is a specialty discipline covered through media monitoring and public consultation teams.

We recommend using the feedback tool in very specific and targeted ways to ensure limited research time is laser focused on turning data into action.

Monitoring trends week over week is a resource-intense activity.

### Long term use

We don't recommend keeping the feedback tool on a page continuously. This reiterates that the tool is for research purposes (rather than monitoring) and to ensure the best use of your time.

### Secure spaces

We don't recommend using the tool within secure spaces. In these spaces, it is better to ensure users have clear access to direct support channels.
