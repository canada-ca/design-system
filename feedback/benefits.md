## Improve content and navigation

Common types of content and navigation problems can be uncovered through feedback.

## Inform policy and program owners

In certain cases, people will leave feedback with their opinions of a certain program or policy. Addressing a policy issue is beyond the scope of web teams, so it's important to share these comments with program and policy colleagues.

## Professionalize content and research operations

### Understand issues from a user perspective

*   Understand what sections / pages of a service or task are affecting task success.
*   Corroborate findings with other sources of data such as call drivers, analytics, or social media.

### Invest in content maintenance throughout its lifecycle

*   Normalize iterative improvements to content.
*   Make time for continuous improvement projects.
*   Monitor feedback to ensure content is meeting user needs after being published.
*   Act on issues related to navigation, content gaps, and comprehension.

### Building linkages and understanding across teams

Sharing how people experience our services gives everyone a ‘front line view’. Building a feedback loop with other communications channels, program and policy authors is part of a holistic approach to service improvement.

Marketing, social media, public outreach may also find these insights useful to identify recurring questions from the public and help hone their messages.

Understand public perception of a program or policy initiative or change - in addition to other formal processes like public consultations or media monitoring.
