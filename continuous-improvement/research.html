        <ul>
           <li><a href="#discovery">Discovery phase</a></li>
           <li><a href="#baseline">Baseline testing phase</a></li>

        </ul>


        <h2 id="discovery">Discovery phase</h2>

        <p>The purpose of the discovery phase is to conduct user research that will:</p>

         <ul>
            <li>help define or refine the specific goals for your project</li>
            <li>identify and learn about the audiences who you aim to serve </li>
            <li>identify challenges those users are currently facing</li>
            <li>form the basis for a usability testing plan</li>
         </ul>



         <h3>Research methods</h3>

          <p>In order to create research questions, you need to understand gaps and weaknesses with the current situation.  Use all or some of these methods to analyze your current situation.</p>


          <h4>Qualitative research</h4>

         <ul>
            <li>Feedback from users</li>
            <li>User interviews</li>
            <li>Previous usability studies</li>
            <li>Usability studies: first click tests, card sorting, tree jacks</li>
            <li>Surveys or other behavioral insights reports</li>
            <li>Social listening: web forums, social media</li>
         </ul>

         <h4>Quantitative research</h4>

        <ul>
           <li>Content inventories and maps</li>
           <li>Call centre reports</li>
           <li>Web analytics</li>
        </ul>

<h4>Discovery is not about solutions, it’s about problems</h4>
<blockquote>



        <p>Avoid making assumptions or thinking about solutions before the research is complete. Solutions and prototypes are built in the next phase</p>
        <p class="small">Source: <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/service-design-playbook">Ontario - Service design playbook</a></p>
      </blockquote>


        <h3>Sharing the discovery research </h3>

        <p>Summarizing and sharing what you’ve learned is an important milestone. This is a living document that you add to as you learn more through your research.  You’ll likely refer back to these artifacts often.</p>

        <h4>Outcomes of the discovery phase </h4>
        <p>You should have: </p>

        <ul>
           <li>an engaged team, management, partners </li>
           <li>a clear understanding of your audiences</li>
           <li>documented user needs</li>
           <li>clear project definitions </li>
           <li>a plan for what tasks should be prototyped and tested</li>
        </ul>


        <h2 id="baseline">Baseline testing</h2>

        <p>While there are many types of research methods you can use to understand your users, watching real people use your content is one of the most effective ways to gather evidence about the problems you’re looking to solve.</p>

        <p>Moderated or unmoderated baseline usability tests are done with people trying scenarios on existing web content. </p>


          <p>At the DTO, we will include 16-18 participants in baseline studies when we want to have reproducible results. </p>

          <p>You can run smaller studies with 6-8 participants to gain insights about specific parts of your site.  In small studies, do not report success or failure as percentages since the results are not reproducible.</p>


    <h3>Recruiting participants</h3>
        <p>Recruit people for your usability tests that are representative of the audience for your content or service.   You can work with a company to help recruit participants or use screening criteria in unmoderated tools to help find the right people to reduce variability in your results.</p>
      <p>Plan to over-recruit - expect that there will be no-shows or that some unmoderated tests may not work out as expected.
</p>

        <h3>Write task scenarios</h3>
        <h4>Research questions</h4>
  <p>Using your discovery research, you now have a prioritized list of challenges that you're facing and potential tasks to test.</p>
        <p>Develop research questions based on these tasks.  (What do you want to find out? To prove?)  Research questions help narrow the scope of your study to the behaviours you want evidence on - <strong>make sure everyone agrees on them!</strong></p>



        <p>With your list of research questions at hand, draft tasks that will help you gather evidence and provide insights about ideas to prototype.</p>

        <h4>Tasks</h4>
        <p>These must be <strong>real things</strong> people are trying to accomplish. </p>

          <p>Hypothesize about what you think may happen during the test.</p>

        <p>We find that we can test 8-10 small tasks in an hour-long moderated session or 5-6 tasks in an unmoderated 30-minute session. </p>

        <h4>Scenarios</h4>
        <p>Scenarios are realistic narratives for a task that the team creates together.</p>

        <p>Using the job story formula, identify a situation a user may find themselves in and the strategies they use to arrive at a desired outcome.</p>

        <p>A job story follows this format:</p>
        <blockquote><p> “When I (situation), I want to (motivation), so I can (expected outcome)”</p></blockquote>

        <p>This is a valuable approach to reinforce your understanding of how and why a service is used. </p>

<div class="well well-sm">
        <p><strong>Example task</strong><br/>Change direct deposit bank account details.</p>

        <p><strong>Job story</strong> <br/><strong>When</strong> I move my mortgage to a new bank, <strong>I want</strong> CRA to put my tax refund into the new account, <strong>so I can</strong> pay my mortgage on time. </p>

        <p><strong>Scenario</strong> <br/>You renewed your mortgage, and you moved all your bank accounts to a new bank. What number would you call to get your personal tax refund into your new bank account? (answer: 1-800-959-8281)</p>
      </div>

        <p>Fine-tune these tasks so they tell you as much as possible, are accurate, and feasible for your participants to complete.  Make sure each task has a clear answer (yes, no, 20%, October..)</p>

        <p>You can ask a friend or colleague to try doing the task to get a sense of whether it will work.</p>






        <h3>Analyzing baseline results</h3>

        <p>Involve everyone on the team in the analysis process, at least as an observer. </p>

        <p>Reviewing transcripts and summary reports is helpful but there is no replacement for first-hand observations with real users. Ensure the whole team can participate by watching videos or live sessions.</p>

        <h4>Take notes of key behaviours during the sessions - share any shorthand you use in your notes:</h4>

        <ul>
           <li>clicks - note all links clicked, and every click on anything, whether it’s clickable or not!</li>
           <li>use identifiers for clicks on navigation like breadcrumb BC, back button B, menu link M</li>
           <li>note search, filter and find attempts with keywords used S keyword, F keyword</li>
           <li>direct quotations of feedback about an issue </li>
           <li>scrolling the page</li>
           <li>reading headings aloud</li>
           <li>skimming text - missing links in skimmed text</li>
           <li>observations about issues encountered</li>
           <li>the point where they arrived on the page with the answer</li>
           <li>if they found the correct answer</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When analyzing the data you’ve collected, read through the notes carefully looking for patterns and be sure to add a description of each of the problems. Look for trends and keep a count of problems that occurred across participants.</p>

<h4>Share your findings</h4>
        <p>Summarize the test results into a usability test report with your findings and recommendations. An effective report will include visuals such as screen shots and short video clips to illustrate specific problems. </p>


        <h4>Outcome of the baseline testing phase</h4>
        <ul>
           <li>You have a baseline score for each task scenario</li>
           <li>You have videos of people attempting tasks</li>
           <li>Project team members and stakeholders have watched all videos for at least 1 task</li>
           <li>You know exactly how many people did what in each case</li>
           <li>You have a list of issues that need to be addressed</li>
           <li>All project stakeholders understand the issues and <strong>want to get them fixed</strong></li>

        </ul>




        <h2 id="prototyping">Prototype improvements</h2>
        <p>Prototypes enable teams to plan: scale, scope and technical challenges become more clear when they are fully designed. Prototypes are then used to test or validate concepts with real users.</p>
<p>There are different approaches to prototyping, from basic wireframing to fully working HTML pages. Basic designs help in the early stages of ideating, while fully working prototypes can make testing easier.</p>

        <p>Prototyping is a risk-reduction strategy, because it enables participants to see the proposed approach, comment on it or correct it, without doing so in a live environment. </p>

        <p>Prototypes can also be an excellent change management tool. Demos of prototypes can bring together diverse perspectives (for instance from communications and policy, or across branch or departmental lines).  </p>

        <p>Ultimately, prototypes are used for testing assumptions with users and not only as a vehicle for approvals.</p>


        <!-- <p>**** needs info in approaches to prototyping **** </p> -->


        <h2 id="comparison">Comparison testing</h2>

        <p>Now test your prototypes to see whether your ideas and solutions work with users. When possible, use the same test questions and testing approach as you did for baseline testing so that you can make direct comparisons and verify whether you met objectives. </p>

        <p>As testing progresses, you may find it necessary to continue fine-tuning or adjusting your prototypes, if participants continue to struggle. The participants will help you understand what helped, and why.  </p>

        <blockquote><p>No matter how smart or experienced you are, you <strong>will</strong> be surprised by what you see people do.</p></blockquote>

        <p>Testing is followed by analysis and reporting. The testing report or presentation should communicate improvements or areas that require further work. Include a plan to complete those additional changes.  </p>

        <p>This report will be a critical tool to build the case for change among decision makers during the following implementation phase. </p>
