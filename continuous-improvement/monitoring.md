<p>
 Monitor and measure content after it goes live. Continuous improvements throughout the content’s life cycle avoids high-effort optimization projects down the road.
</p>

<h2 id="indicators">
 Establish performance indicators
</h2>

<p>
 For continuous improvement to work well, you need to establish performance indicators and identify data sources that help you evaluate how your content or service is performing.
</p>

<p>
 We can use data to make sure that:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  people can complete their task
 </li>
 <li>
  content is easy to find and understand
 </li>
 <li>
  information is up to date and accurate
 </li>
</ul>

 GC Task Success Survey
</h2>

<p>
 As part of reporting requirements for the Government of Canada, Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat has adopted the task success survey method as a primary means of measuring the performance of web content and services.
</p>

<p>
 All departments and agencies subject to the
 <cite>
  Directive on the Management of Communications
 </cite>
 are required to implement the GC Task Success Survey on their web properties.

<h2 id="monitoring">
 Monitoring other performance indicators
</h2>

<p>
 Monitoring other data sources and performance indicators can uncover potential problems with your content or service.
</p>

<p>
 Combining data from multiple sources gives you a richer picture of how your content or service is performing.
</p>

<p>
 Additional data sources include:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  user feedback
 </li>
 <li>
  call centre data (calls, emails)
 </li>
 <li>
  social media monitoring
 </li>
 <li>
  web analytics
 </li>
 <li>
  interviews (users, front-line staff)
 </li>
 <li>
  usability tests with talk-aloud protocol
 </li>
 <li>
  others (financial statements, public opinion research, etc.)
 </li>
</ul>

<p>
 It’s best to combine metrics with usability testing to validate proposed improvements.

 Continuous improvement
</h2>

<p>
 Use the data you’ve been monitoring (such as user feedback, analytics, and user research) to find ways to improve your content. Evaluate proposed improvements with usability testing.
</p>

<p>
 Over time, programs and policies change and your content will need to change accordingly. With each change comes a new opportunity to research, prototype, and test out solutions before going live.
