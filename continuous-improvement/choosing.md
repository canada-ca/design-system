<h2 id="why">
 Use a task-based approach
</h2>

<p>
 Canada.ca is the Government of Canada primary service delivery channel.
</p>

<p>
 People visit Canada.ca to do things like:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  learn about health risks
 </li>
 <li>
  apply for passports
 </li>
 <li>
  pay their taxes
 </li>
 <li>
  receive benefits
 </li>
 <li>
  find jobs
 </li>
 <li>
  learn about product recalls
 </li>
 <li>
  better understand current international trade negotiations
 </li>
</ul>

<p>
 People come to Canada.ca to complete
 <strong>
  tasks
 </strong>
 that let them fulfill their goals or objectives. For example, the tasks might be to check eligibility requirements and apply for a benefit. The goal is to receive the benefit payment.
</p>

<p>
 Improving services on Canada.ca means ensuring that people are able to complete their tasks as efficiently and easily as possible.
</p>

<h2 id="top">
 Top tasks
</h2>

<p>
 Use a people-centred and data-driven way to focus and prioritize improvement efforts on the web by focusing on top tasks.
</p>

<p>
 Determining what the top tasks are for your organization is crucial to focusing on what matters.
</p>

<p>
 The GC Task Success Survey offers you a people-centred and data-driven way to prioritize your improvement efforts:
</p>

  </a>
 </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="choose">
 Improving the right thing
</h2>

<p>
 You won’t be able to improve everything. Some tasks are much more important to your users – and to your mandate – than others.
</p>

<p>
 To choose what to improve, focus on 3 things:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  identify what tasks are causing the
  <strong>
   greatest challenges
  </strong>
 </li>
 <li>
  understand how these problems are affecting your users and internal resources
 </li>
 <li>
  choose what is
  <strong>
   feasible
  </strong>
  for you to improve, given time limits, organizational culture and interest levels
 </li>
</ul>

<p>
 Use data from task success surveys, direct feedback, call centres and other sources to determine your priorities.

<h3>
 Task success survey results
</h3>

<p>
 Results and feedback from task success surveys will help you identify which tasks could be good candidates for improvement.
</p>

<p>
 The GC Task Success Survey lets you measure and monitor results:

<h3>
 Frustration expressed through direct feedback
</h3>

<p>
 Analyzing  direct feedback from people using your information through exit surveys, page feedback, and previous usability testing can help you narrow in on specific problems.

<h3>
 Call drivers, complaints, social media listening
</h3>

<p>
 Are you getting more calls, or more complaints from your users about specific services? Is your front-line staff describing areas of struggle? Is there a sudden flurry of posts related to your services on social media? These are clear indicators of areas you may need to focus on.
