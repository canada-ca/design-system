<p>
 The page feedback tool is still in a pilot phase.
</p>

<h2 id="why">
 Why collect user feedback
</h2>

<p>
 User feedback can be useful to a range of people working on a product or service, including:  web teams, program specialists, policy analysts, and other communications professionals (social media, outreach).
</p>

<p>
 Combining qualitative insights with quantitative data is a step towards building a content culture that is human-centred, evidence-driven, and iterative.
</p>

<blockquote>
 <p>
  Client feedback is a critical input into ensuring that services meet the needs of clients and to support continual improvement.

</blockquote>

<p>
 Collecting feedback:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  brings the voice of users into focus
 </li>
 <li>
  normalizes the continuous improvement of content
 </li>
 <li>
  identities issues affecting content effectiveness and task success
 </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="when">
 When to use the page feedback tool
</h2>

<p>
 First use the GC Task Success Survey to identify tasks that you would like to improve.   Then add the page feedback tool on specific pages related to that task to uncover specific page-level issues affecting task performance.
</p>

<h2 id="how">
 How it works
</h2>

<p>
 The feedback tool is an optional pattern.  Add it to the bottom of a content page after the page content and before the date modified.  It replaces the “Report a problem” pattern while actively collecting user feedback.
</p>

<p class="mrgn-tp-lg">
 The feedback tool invites visitors to:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  indicate if they found what they were looking for (yes / no)
 </li>
 <li>
  indicate a reason for why not (information was not clear)
 </li>
 <li>
  offer their feedback describing the problem
 </li>
</ul>
