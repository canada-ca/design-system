  <h4>Alphabetical lists</h4>
  <p>Only present your web content in an alphabetical order if it's the most logical and intuitive approach for the audience. </p>
  <p>For example, listing provinces and territories in alphabetical order could be appropriate. </p>
  <p>If you present content in alphabetical order in English, also present it in alphabetical order in French to provide the same intuitive experience.</p>
