      <h4>Writing for readability</h4>
      <p>Readability is the ease with which a person can read and understand a text. Readable content means better task completion and higher client satisfaction. </p>
      <p>To make your content readable, consider your audience's reading level and literacy needs. Not everyone reads at the same level or understands content in the same way. Even when content is presented clearly and simply, people who have low literacy levels and other difficulties can find it hard to understand text. </p>
      <p>According to Statistics Canada (2012) and Canadian literacy organizations, almost 50% of Canadians have literacy challenges. Research shows that people with literacy challenges:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>spend a lot of time trying to understand words that contain more than two syllables</li>
        <li>read word by word and slowly move their eyes across each line of text</li>
        <li>skip over large amounts of information when it contains many multi-syllable words, uncommon terms and long sentences </li>
      </ul>
