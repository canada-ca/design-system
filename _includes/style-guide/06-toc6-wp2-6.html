    <h3>2.6 Use simple sentences</h3>
    <p>Keep sentence structure simple by putting the subject and the verb at the beginning of the sentence and by using the subject + verb + object construction. This structure helps the reader understand what the subject of the sentence is doing by placing the subject first, followed by the verb.</p>
    <p>Avoid complex and compound sentences. They generally contain too much information for people to understand when they're scanning.</p>
    <h4 class="h5">Examples <span class="wb-inv">of simple sentences</span></h4>
    <p><strong>Write</strong>: Learn about Canada's transportation system. Find information about using paved roads, bike trails, airports and ports across the country. <br>
      <strong>Instead of</strong>: Canada's vast transportation system enables millions of people each year to travel throughout the country, around the world, and to work and back. From this page you can access a wealth of transportation information related to travelling and commuting.</p>
    <p class="mrgn-tp-lg">Replace complex sentence structures with direct statements.</p>
    <h4 class="h5">Examples <span class="wb-inv">of direct statements</span></h4>
    <p><strong>Write</strong>: You have until April 30 to file your tax return.<br>
      <strong>Instead of</strong>: The period of time that you have to file your tax return ends on April 30.</p>
    <p class="mrgn-tp-lg">Replace noun strings (a series of 2 or more nouns used to name something) with direct statements. </p>
    <h4>Examples <span class="wb-inv">of statements that avoid chains of nouns</span></h4>
    <p><strong>Write</strong>: The evaluation team will submit its final report on the training program in September.<br>
      <strong>Instead of</strong>: The training program evaluation team will submit its final report in September.</p>
    <p>Surround a long sentence with shorter ones because it helps people understand the long sentence. </p>
