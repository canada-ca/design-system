    <h3>Plain language requirements</h3>
    <p>The use of plain language is a requirement of the <cite><a href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=30682">Directive on the Management of Communications</a></cite>.</p>
    <p>Writing in plain language doesn't mean over-simplifying or leaving out critical information. Using plain language actually makes critical information accessible and readable for everyone.</p>
    <p>By writing plainly and simply, you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>increase the chances that people will find, read and understand your information from any device</li>
      <li>make your information more accessible to people with disabilities</li>
      <li>allow people who are reading your information on a small screen to see essential information first</li>
      <li>save resources when editing and translating your text</li>
      <li>improve task completion and cuts costs by, for example, reducing enquiries</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section id="wp2-1">
    <h3>2.1 Start with the most important information</h3>
    <p>Start your content with the most important information, and be direct. When people scan web pages, they tend to start in the top left hand corner and scan to the right and down. As they move down the page, they scan less and less to the right.</p>
    <p>Organize your content using an inverted pyramid structure to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>guide your audience to the information they need to complete their task </li>
      <li>place supporting and relevant details toward the end of the text </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The inverted pyramid structure is divided into four sections, from top to bottom. It shows the order of information on a web page.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>add details and tasks in order of importance</li>
          <li>keep all task related content in the centre of the page</li>
          <li>use links to direct people to key information and tasks</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Third:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>include information for audiences who want to learn more or have more knowledge of the topic or service, but only if it makes sense</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Fourth:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>add links only if they relate to content that supports completion of the task on the web page (for example, laws or publications)</li>

      <h4>Get to the point</h4>
      <p>Omit background information and messages that welcome people to your program or site. These kinds of messages get in people's way when they're trying to accomplish a task.</p>

    </ul>
    <section id="wp2-3-1">
      <h4>Active or passive voice</h4>
      <p>In an active sentence, the subject does the action. The sentence is clear and direct.</p>
      <p>In a passive sentence, it may not be clear who or what is doing the action. </p>
      <section>
        <h5>Example <span class="wb-inv">of passive and active sentences</span></h5>
        <p><strong>Active</strong>: We may ask you to provide proof of citizenship.<br>

    </section>
    <section id="wp2-3-2">
      <h4>Positive or negative form</h4>
      <p>Whenever possible, tell people what they may or must do instead of what they may not or must not do. Avoid negatives, double negatives and exceptions to exceptions.</p>
      <section>
        <h5>Examples <span class="wb-inv">of positive and negative sentences</span></h5>
        <p><strong>Positive</strong>: You're entitled to part of the deduction.<br>
          <strong>Negative</strong>: You're not entitled to the entire deduction.</p>
        <p><strong>Positive</strong>: The procedure will be effective.<br>
          <strong>Double</strong> <strong>negative</strong>: The procedure will not be ineffective.</p>
        <p><strong>Positive</strong>: You may claim a child born in 1972 or earlier as a dependent, if he or she has a mental or physical disability.<br>
          <strong>Double negative</strong>: You may not claim anything for a dependent child born in 1972 or earlier, unless the child has a mental or physical disability.</p>
      </section>
      <p class="mrgn-tp-lg">If something has serious consequences, you can use the negative form to explain that something isn't possible or should not be done. </p>

    <h3>2.5 Avoid jargon, idioms and expressions </h3>
    <p>Where possible, avoid using jargon, idioms and expressions. Use the clearest, most popular term for your audience.</p>
    <p>Legal and technical terms and "government-speak" confuse most people.</p>
    <p>People who don't speak English or French might use online tools to translate text. These tools don't always translate idioms and expressions accurately. </p>

      <p><strong>Jargon</strong>: bench warrant (an order by a judge to arrest someone who didn't show up in court or comply with certain conditions)</p>
      <p><strong>Idiom</strong>: to hire a helping hand (meaning to hire an employee)</p>
      <p><strong>Expression</strong>: attack your least favourite task first (meaning do your least favourite task first)</p>

    <h3>2.6 Use simple sentences</h3>
    <p>Keep sentence structure simple by putting the subject and the verb at the beginning of the sentence and by using the subject + verb + object construction. This structure helps the reader understand what the subject of the sentence is doing by placing the subject first, followed by the verb.</p>
    <p>Avoid complex and compound sentences. They generally contain too much information for people to understand when they're scanning.</p>

      <p><strong>Write</strong>: Learn about Canada's transportation system. Find information about using paved roads, bike trails, airports and ports across the country. <br>

    <h3>2.7 Use short sentences and paragraphs</h3>
    <p>Be concise. Use as few words as possible to express an idea. By being concise, you'll help everyone, even specialists, complete the task they set out to do.</p>
    <p>Keep sentences and paragraphs short to make them easier to scan on any screen size. People who have learning disabilities may find it difficult to scan and understand long sentences and paragraphs. </p>
    <p>Try to keep sentences under 20 words. You can do this by:&nbsp; </p>
    <ul>
      <li>breaking long sentences into shorter ones</li>
      <li>limiting each sentence to 1 idea </li>

    <h3>2.8 Explain references to legislation</h3>
    <p>When explaining a requirement that comes from an act or regulation, avoid mentioning the act or regulation by name. Include only the information people need to complete the task.</p>
    <p>If you <strong>must </strong>include the name of the act or regulation, always give a plain-language description. First, explain what your audience needs to know and why they need to know more about the act or regulation. Then, you may add the reference to the act or regulation.</p>

    <h3>2.9 Check the reading level of the content</h3>
    <p>Check the reading level of your text. Make sure that it meets the reading level you're targeting based on the literacy needs of your audience. Do this every so often while you're writing content. You can use various tools to do this. </p>
    <p>Readability tools help you check if content is too wordy or complex. Writing content at a reading level above grade 8 can make it difficult for many people to understand or complete their task. </p>
    <section id="wp2-9-1">
      <h4>Use a readability tool</h4>
      <p>You can use a readability tool like Flesch-Kincaid to check the reading level of your English content. This tool is available as part of Microsoft Word. It generally reflects the years of education needed to understand the text.</p>
      <p>To use Flesch-Kincaid: </p>
      <ol start="1" type="1">
        <li>in Word 2010 and later, click the <strong>File</strong> tab, and then click <strong>Options</strong></li>
        <li>click <strong>Proofing</strong></li>
        <li>under <strong>When correcting spelling and grammar in Word</strong>, make sure the <strong>Check grammar with spelling</strong> check box is selected</li>
        <li>select <strong>Show readability statistics &nbsp;</strong></li>
      </ol>
      <p>You can check the reading level of a whole page or just part of a page. To check the reading level:</p>
      <ol start="1" type="1">
        <li>accept any tracked changes</li>
        <li>place periods at the end of any bulleted items and headings (remove the periods before publishing) </li>
        <li>highlight the text in your Word document</li>
        <li>click the <strong>Review</strong> tab</li>
        <li>click <strong>Spelling &amp; Grammar</strong></li>
        <li>when Word has finished checking the text, it will ask whether you want to check the rest of the content</li>
        <li>click <strong>No</strong></li>
      </ol>
      <p>If your text contains technical terms that consist of long, multi-syllable words that you need to use for your specialized audience, remove these terms before you test the content for readability to see whether the surrounding text can be simplified. Reinsert the technical terms once you've simplified the surrounding text.</p>
      <p>The Readability Statistics dialog box will appear and show the Flesch-Kincaid grade level. </p>

      <h4>Follow the reading level requirements</h4>
      <p>Evaluate the reading level of content as follows for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>navigation content (home, theme and topic pages), aim for no higher than grade 8</li>
        <li>all other content intended for general audiences, aim for grade 8 or lower</li>
        <li>content intended for experts, determine the appropriate grade level and apply it across all content for this audience</li>

      <h4>Verify whether the content is easy to understand</h4>
      <p>Readability tools reveal the reading level of your content, but they can't tell you whether it makes sense. </p>
      <p>To check whether your content is easy to read and understand, test it:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>ask colleagues who aren't familiar with the subject to review the text for clarity and logic</li>
        <li>work with your communications team to set up usability testing for your content</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If your content has a high reading level, or if usability testing shows low task completion, try to: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>shorten words, sentences or paragraphs, but keep words of 3 or more syllables if they're well known</li>
        <li>replace technical jargon with terms that people will understand</li>
        <li>remove details that people don't need to complete the task</li>
        <li>replace secondary references to a program with "program" rather than using its full name or abbreviation</li>
        <li>create numbered or bulleted lists for key tasks</li>
      </ul>
