  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>This guide establishes the rules you must use to develop and edit English web content that will be published on a Government of Canada website. The rules are different from practices adapted to print to support principles related to accessibility, readability and usability.</p>
  <p>The purpose of these rules is to make web content easy to find, easy to understand and easy to use for everyone, including people who have physical or cognitive disabilities. </p>
  <p>The techniques described in this guide complement the rules set out in <cite><a href="https://www.btb.termiumplus.gc.ca/tpv2guides/guides/tcdnstyl/index-eng.html?lang=eng">The Canadian Style</a></cite>. If there are conflicts between this guide and <cite>The Canadian Style</cite> or any other resource, this guide takes priority for content published online.</p>
  <p>As web and language trends evolve, we'll update this guide to meet the changing needs of our audiences.</p>
