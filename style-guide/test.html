    <p>Small changes make a big difference.</p>
    <p>Sometimes the words we use, and how we organize them, can make it hard for people to find and understand
        Government of Canada information and services on Canada.ca. The <abbr
            title="Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat">TBS</abbr> Digital Transformation Office is working on projects
        with federal departments to make it easier.</p>
    <p>For each project, we co-create prototypes, set concrete usability targets, and run usability tests with
        Canadians. We ask questions Canadians have about specific Government of Canada services. For a prototype to
        launch, it must make it at least 20% easier for people to get the right answer.</p>
    <p>Considering the high numbers of visits to in-demand pages, such an increase in task success rates is significant.
        Ultimately it means people spend less time looking for the answers they need from the Government of Canada.
