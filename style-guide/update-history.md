    <p>We updated the subsection <a href="/style-guide/#wp4-1-1">Titles, headings and subheadings</a> to clarify that punctuation should not be added at the end of table captions and headers. This is already noted in the French guidance.</p>
    <p>We also updated <a href="/style-guide/#wp4-6">section 4.6 Numbers</a> to provide guidance on when to spell out numbers versus using digits, and included specific examples.</p>
    <p>Related to this, we updated the <a href="/style-guide/#wp4-1-5">subsection Hyphens and dashes</a> to allow for the use of en dashes in a span of fiscal or calendar years in English. We consulted with the Accessibility, Accommodation and Adaptive Computer Technology (AAACT) program for this update. They tested all uses of hyphens and dashes with numbers using various screen readers. We also added a new subsection for <a href="{{ site.urlconception }}/guide-redaction/#wp4-1-4">hyphens and dashes (traits d'union et tirets)</a> in French.</p>

This update was done in collaboration with plain language experts and communications professionals from across the Government of Canada.</p>

    <p>As of January 2024, <cite>The Canadian Style</cite> and <cite>Le guide du rédacteur</cite> were archived, with their content integrated into <a href="https://www.noslangues-ourlanguages.gc.ca/en/writing-tips-plus/index-eng"><cite>Writing Tips Plus</cite></a> and the <span lang=fr><a href="https://www.noslangues-ourlanguages.gc.ca/fr/cles-de-la-redaction/index-fra"><cite>Clés de la rédaction</cite></a></span>. We updated references and links in the following sections:</p>

   </ul>

   <p>We updated <a href="/style-guide/#wp2-1">the inverted pyramid image</a> in section 2.1 Start with the most important information. We removed most of the words from the image and worked it into the page content to make the section easier to read.</p>

   <p>In <a href="/style-guide/#wp4-4">section 4.4 Abbreviations and acronyms</a> added quick reference links to help users find information related to abbreviations. This includes:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>update to specify that abbreviations should be accompanied by their long form the first time they're used on a page</li>
         <li><a href="/style-guide/#wp4-4-2">new subsection Styles of address</a>, which includes:
            <ul>
               <li>how to abbreviate, punctuate and format titles, degrees and distinctions with personal names (for example, PhD, Ph.D. Dr.)</li>
               <li>styles of address and honorific titles</li>
            </ul></li>
      </ul>
<p>We added a subsection <a href="/style-guide/#wp7-2-2">Use parentheses for contextual information</a> under section 7.2 Write descriptive links to clarify how and when to add additional information inside hyperlinks. This new section integrates the content from section 7.4, which is no longer necessary.</p>
