title: Design guidance for AI help applications

AI applications must meet the [Canada.ca design requirements]({{ site.url }}/specifications.html). Use this guidance to provide a consistent experience with AI help applications across Canada.ca.

## Before you begin designing {#before}

Before considering the design stage, consult:

- [Guide on the use of generative AI](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/responsible-use-ai/guide-use-generative-ai.html)
- [Digital Standards Playbook](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/government-canada-digital-standards.html)

For information and guidance on specific uses of generative AI, contact the Responsible Data and AI team:

## Naming your AI application {#naming}

Do not use a human name for your AI application. Do not use the words "chat" or "chatbot". These terms are commonly associated with live-chat support and can lead users to assume a human agent may join or may be monitoring the conversation. By avoiding human names and words like "chat" you clarify to users that the responses come solely from the AI and that no human will be responding to their questions.

## Open a new browser window, not a chat panel {#window}

Use a full-page URL for your AI application to open in a new window, rather than a narrow panel on an existing page. This accessible approach allows for faster iteration, deployment, and management. It also differentiates your application from non-AI chats.

## Initiate chat with links or overlay bars {#initiate}

Use a link or mobile-first bottom-overlay instead of a floating-at-bottom-right chat button. People often ignore or miss floating chat buttons. They're also a significant barrier to mobile users.
