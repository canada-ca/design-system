title: Central guidance and AI research
---

As the Government of Canada, we must follow all applicable laws, policies, directives and standards when communicating with the public. As it relates specifically to AI help applications, ensure you consult the following sources.

## Guide on the use of generative AI

Follow the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat's Guide on the use of generative AI to design AI help applications that are easy to use, ethical, accessible and trustworthy.

- [Guide on the use of generative AI](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/responsible-use-ai/guide-use-generative-ai.html)

This guide cites public chatbots as a higher risk use case and includes best practices for the use and deployment of these tools. Remember to follow the "<span class="text-uppercase">faster</span>" principles: fair, accountable, secure, transparent, educated and relevant, that are outlined in the guide.

## Digital Standards Playbook

Follow the Digital Standards Playbook. These standards form the foundation of the government's shift to becoming more agile, open, and user-focused. They will guide teams in designing digital services in a way that best serves Canadians.
