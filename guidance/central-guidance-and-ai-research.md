title: Central guidance and AI research
---

Every day, thousands of visitors come to Canada.ca seeking information. However, based on the daily feedback we receive from GC Feedback, we know that not everyone finds what they need. Much of the feedback is questions about how to interpret the page for their specific situation, how to find a particular answer and how to get a telephone number.

The goal of AI chat applications on Canada.ca is to provide quick, accurate and tailored answers to users' questions about GC services.

### Follow the central guidance

You should follow the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat’s [Guide on the use of generative AI](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/responsible-use-ai/guide-use-generative-ai.html). This guide cites public AI chat applications and chatbots as a higher risk use case. The guidance is intended to support teams in maintaining the public trust in Canada.ca while meeting the “FASTER” principles (fair, accountable, secure, transparent, educated and relevant) that are outlined in the guide.

* For information and guidance on specific uses of generative AI, contact the Responsible Data and AI team: [ai-ia@tbs-sct.gc.ca](mailto:ai-ia@tbs-sct.gc.ca)   
* For AI security questions and advice, contact: [zztbscybers@tbs-sct.gc.ca](mailto:zztbscybers@tbs-sct.gc.ca)
