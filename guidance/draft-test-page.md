title: Guidance for AI chat applications on Canada.ca

People expect and trust consistency and transparency on Canada.ca, including in AI interactions. This guidance aims to provide a unified voice for Government of Canada AI chat applications, assisting government teams in delivering trustworthy and effective generative AI solutions.

Use this guidance when building a public-facing AI chat application. The guidance will continue to evolve over time as we build and test applications with departments.
