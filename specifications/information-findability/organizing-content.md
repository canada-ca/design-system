    <h2 id="toc1">How people find tasks</h2>
    <p>Canada.ca helps people navigate in 3 different ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="theme-navigation"><strong>Theme navigation:</strong> people who do not know which institution offers what they are looking for can find it through theme and topic pages</li>
      <li><strong>Institutional navigation:</strong> people can find what they are looking for directly through the institutional presence of each department</li>
      <li><strong>Search:</strong> supports findability for both theme and institutional navigation through the on and off-site search engine</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Most people looking for government services and information don't understand how government is organized. To address this, the theme-based navigation is the priority navigation path on Canada.ca.</p>
    <p>See where your content fits under themes and their corresponding topics in the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/government/about/design-system/topic-tree-content-types.html#tree">Canada.ca Topic tree</a>.</p>

        <p>People who may not understand the operations or organization of the Government of Canada (GC) may access content through theme navigation. Theme pages organize topics in a way that people understand so they can find content that supports their tasks quickly. Theme pages link to topic pages and/or destination content. Topic pages allow people to discover top-task content related to a specific GC-wide topic. They also link to destination content.

          People can also access content through institutional navigation. This navigation is intended for people who are accustomed to dealing with specific institutions. An Institutional/Organizational profile presents all timely and relevant content offered by an institution. It then leads people to either theme or topic pages, or directly into destination content. Destination content is about services or information, program and policy development, news, campaigns and promotions, or corporate information.</p>

      <h2 id="user">User-need categories for destination content</h2>
      <p>Organize your content to fit under one of these 5 user-need categories:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><a href="#services">Services and information</a></li>
        <li><a href="#program">Program and policy development</a></li>

      <section>
        <h3 id="services">Services and information</h3>
        <p>Services and information form the core content that allows a person to complete a task.</p>
        <p>Tasks can range from very simple to very complex. They can be informational or transactional. Tasks can be things like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>find a contact</li>
          <li>get the weather forecast</li>
          <li>find out what you need to report on your tax return</li>
          <li>apply for a visa</li>
          <li>get EI benefits</li>
          <li>get ideas on places to visit in Canada</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This category consists of content that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>allows people to initiate a transaction with the government</li>
          <li>answers questions people have about government services</li>
          <li>focuses on what people can do or are looking for, not on what the government offers</li>
          <li>helps people complete a task, and may include reports, guides, digital services or databases</li>
        </ul>

<h3>Content types</h3>
<p>A content type is a unique element describing the nature of the page content.</p>
<p>Use the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/government/about/design-system/topic-tree-content-types.html#types">Canada.ca  content type list</a>, a common taxonomy, to classify and filter large lists of content based on content type. </p>

  <h4>Current content</h4>
  <p>Current content is information and services that are actively sought out by people. It can also be content that must  be available to the public at all times. </p>
</section>
<section>
