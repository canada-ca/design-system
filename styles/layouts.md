   The underlying grid system for Canada.ca allows for responsive layouts at various screen sizes. This allows for flexible layouts while maintaining consistent placement of elements.
  </p>
  <p>
   The default maximum content width is 1140 pixels. In some rare cases, a layout may need to be wider. For example, some very large data tables may be too wide to fit in this space. This will require viewers to scroll right to see the entire layout.
  </p>
  <p>
   On smaller screens layouts will typically display as a single-column.
