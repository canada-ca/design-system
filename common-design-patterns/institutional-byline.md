<section class="alert alert-info">
  <p>We are decommissioning the <b>institutional byline pattern</b>. We do not recommend adding this pattern to your pages. If you would like to link to the institutions or organizations that support the content on the page please use the <a href="/contributors.html">contributors pattern</a>.</p>

  <p>
   The institutional byline provides people with a link to the institution or institutions responsible for the content.

   The institutional byline is not a mandatory pattern for pages on canada.ca

   <h2>
    When to use this pattern
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Use only on destination pages such as service initiation or generic pages; do not use on navigation pages like themes, topic pages, institutional/organizational profiles
    </li>
    <li>
     Use only once on the page to provide a link to the institution, organization or similar entity responsible for the content
    </li>
   </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
   <h2>
    How to use this pattern
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     The link to the institution or organization is introduced by the word “From:”
    </li>
    <li>
     Only links pointing to institutional profile pages, organizational profile pages, or partnering/collaborative arrangement profile pages are permitted
    </li>
    <li>
     Only one institution or organization should appear in the institutional byline
    </li>
    <li>
     The link label must be the same as the name that appears on the institutional or organizational profile page being linked to
    </li>
    <li>
     Position the institutional byline directly underneath the page title, aligned to the left
    </li>
    <li>
     Use standard paragraph and link styles
    </li>
    <li>
     Do not place this block in line with other text blocks or layout elements; it stands alone
    </li>
   </ul>
