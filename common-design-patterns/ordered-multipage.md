title: Ordered multi-page navigation design pattern
---


<div>
 
 <section>
  <p>
   The ordered multi-page navigation pattern:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    is a set of links to a group of several pages intended to be read in a preferred order
   </li>
   <li>
    includes previous/next links to guide a person through the page set in the preferred order
   </li>
  </ul>
  <section>
   <h2>
    Objective
   </h2>
   <p>
    Use the ordered  multi-page navigation pattern  to provide:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     an outline of content that spans multiple pages and has a default or preferred order (for example, guides, service initiations, sequential instructions)
    </li>
    <li>
     a method of jumping to any page within the sequence,  bypassing the default order of the pages
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Do not use this pattern when:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     the content exists as a single page requiring scrolling to view all the subsections (use the
     <a href="./in-page-toc.html">
      In-page table of contents pattern
     </a>
     )
    </li>
    <li>
     the content exists as a set of multiple pages that does not have a default or preferred order
    </li>
    <li>
     the default order of the content must not be circumvented that is when the preferred order is crucial and people cannot be permitted to move between pages in       a different order
    </li>
   </ul>

   <h2>
    How and when to use ordered multi-page navigation
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Always position the ordered  multi-page navigation pattern at the start of the page, before the substantive content of the page begins
    </li>
    <li>
     Ensure that the order and position of the page links are identical on each page of the set
    </li>
    <li>
     Number the step-by-step links to indicate the preferred order. Not all links necessarily need to be numbered, if they represent pages/steps that are not part of the sequence
    </li>
    <li>
     Highlight the link for the current page. Do not highlight with the same colour used on primary action buttons
    </li>
    <li>
     Position previous/next links immediately below the substantive content on the page
    </li>
    <li>
     Accompany the previous/next labels with arrow icons to reinforce the concept
    </li>
    <li>
     Position previous/next links consistently (for example, “previous” on the left, “next” on the right)
    </li>
    <li>
     On the first page of the document, omit the “previous” link; on the last page of the document, omit the “next” link
    </li>
   </ul>
