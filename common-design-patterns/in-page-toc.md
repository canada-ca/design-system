title: In-page table of contents design pattern
---





<section>
 <p>
  The in-page table of contents pattern is a list of links that lead to subsections of the same page. This pattern is intended for long documents that exist as a single page.
 </p>
 <section>
  <h2>
   Objective
  </h2>
  <p>
   Use the in-page  table of contents pattern  to:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    provide an outline for the content of a single page that has multiple subsections
   </li>
   <li>
    provide an alternative method to jump to specific content on the page,  without using the scroll bar
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Use this pattern when:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    excessive scrolling is required to view all of the content on the page
   </li>
   <li>
    the page is divided into subsections, each with its own headings
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Do not use this pattern when the document exists across several web pages. Instead, use the multi-page  table of contents pattern.

  <h2>
   How and when to use an in-page table of contents
  </h2>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Always position the in-page  table of contents pattern  at the start of the page, before the substantive content of the page begins
   </li>
   <li>
    Label the pattern “On this page” to distinguish it from other page content and to provide consistency throughout the site
   </li>
   <li>
    Present links using list elements—bullets for an unordered list, numbers for an ordered list
   </li>
   <li>
    Use standard linking styles to ensure that the links present as clickable elements
   </li>
   <li>
    Present the in-page table of contents aligned to the left, as a vertical list, as opposed to using a column layout
   </li>
  </ul>
