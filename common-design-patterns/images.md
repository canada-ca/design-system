title: Images design pattern
---





<section>
 <p>
  Images are visual content that complements or enhances text, including photographs, graphics, drawings, or diagrams.
 </p>
 <section>
  <h2>
   When to use this pattern
  </h2>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Avoid unnecessary decoration on Canada.ca – only use imagery when it provides more information than can be provided through text alone
   </li>
   <li>
    Refer to the
    <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/government-communications/canada-content-style-guide.html#toc10">
     Canada.ca Content Style Guide for details on when to use images
    </a>
   </li>
   <li>
    Do not use images as stand-alone clickable elements providing navigation or functionality
   </li>
   <li>
    Images must be clickable when accompanied by text links, but are secondary to the links
   </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>
   How to use this pattern
  </h2>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Size and place images appropriately for the context they are in
    <ul>
     <li>
      images must appear connected to the content, and complement it
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    Do not place images in line with text blocks, for example within a paragraph; instead, place them in between text blocks
   </li>
   <li>
    Where images include people, they should reflect Canada’s diverse population
   </li>
   <li>
    Images must appear square or rectangular;  round or oval images may not be used
   </li>
   <li>
    Where captions and attributions are required, place them immediately under the image they refer to
   </li>
   <li>
    Images must only be clickable when accompanied by a text link to the same destination
    <ul>
     <li>
      in such cases, the default position for text links is immediately above the image
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    Align links, captions or attributions with the left edge of the image they refer to
   </li>
   <li>
    Do not use images or videos copied from other websites
   </li>
   <li>
    Do not use images to display text
    <ul>
     <li>
      text on feature images may be difficult to read on a small screen
     </li>
     <li>
      images may instead focus on photography and illustration
     </li>
     <li>
      incidental snippets of text, such as text appearing on photographed objects, wordmarks in logos, #hashtags, etc., are acceptable
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </section>
 <section>
  <h2>
   Licensing
  </h2>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Institutions are responsible for the proper use of images purchased through a licensing agreement
    <ul>
     <li>
      if the image is licensed only to one institution, it can only be used by that institution on Canada.ca
     </li>
     <li>
      read the licensing agreement carefully for any other restrictions on the use of purchased images
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    Verify that you have the appropriate rights to publish images on Canada.ca. Specifically:
    <ul>
     <li>
      get a signed release from a person (or legal guardian) before you publish any image of him or her
     </li>
     <li>
      have documentation showing you have the appropriate rights to publish licensed (or rights-managed) images
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    Images that are no longer licensed for use by an institution must be removed from Canada.ca
   </li>
   <li>
    Purchase the highest-resolution available for an image,  to be able to use the image in any size
   </li>
  </ul>
