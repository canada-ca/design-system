---


<div>
 
 <section>
  <p>
   The social media channels block (“follow box”) is an in-page component that allows people to follow official Government of Canada social media accounts from various social media platforms.
  </p>
  <section>
   <h2>
    When to use this pattern
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Use the follow box on pages where official
     <abbr title="Government of Canada">
      GC
     </abbr>
     social media accounts are relevant to the current context
    </li>
    <li>
     Do not use this component when a person’s flow must not be interrupted, as in a transactional process
    </li>
    <li>
     Do not duplicate content from other promotional components on the page
    </li>
   </ul>

   <h2>
    How to use this pattern
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     The social media channels follow box is made up of the heading “Follow” and icons linking to official
     <abbr title="Government of Canada">
      GC
     </abbr>
     social media accounts or  RSS feeds that are relevant to the page
    </li>
    <li>
     Accounts referred to in the follow box must be fully compliant with the
     <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=30682">
      Directive on the Management of Communications
     </a>
    </li>
    <li>
     Display a maximum of 7 icons aligned in a horizontal row, using the standard icon set available in the Canada.ca
     <abbr title="Web Experience Toolkit">
      WET
     </abbr>
     theme
    </li>
    <li>
     Use only one icon per social media platform; if there is more than one account from a single platform
     <ul>
      <li>
       make them available via a clickable drop-down menu
      </li>
      <li>
       populate the drop-down menu with up to 8 text links, using the names of the accounts as labels
      </li>
      <li>
       if more than 8 links are required, include a “view all” link as the final item in the list; this link must point to the relevant section of the Canada.ca social media gallery, where all relevant accounts will be listed
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
     Position the follow box so that it does not interfere with the primary content of the page
    </li>
    <li>
     Emphasize the box shape of this component by using a background colour that is darker than the surrounding page area’s background colour
    </li>
    <li>
     Use the defined presentation classes included in the Canada.ca
     <abbr title="Web Experience Toolkit">
      WET
     </abbr>
     theme
    </li>
   </ul>
