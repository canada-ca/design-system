  <h2>Decommissioning</h2>
  <p>We’re decommissioning this pattern and don’t recommend using it on your pages. Follow the <a href="https://design.canada.ca/style-guide/#toc11">Canada.ca Content Style Guide guidance on links</a>.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>The related links pattern is a list of links to content that is related to the page on which it appears</p>
  <section>
    <h2>When to use this pattern</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use this pattern to provide links to content that is directly relevant to the content on the current page</li>
        <li>Do not use the related links pattern when a person’s flow must not be interrupted such as in a transactional process</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>How to use this pattern</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Position the list of links after the main content of the page, but before the footer section
        <ul>
          <li>a consistent location at the bottom of the content area helps a person recognize the function of this pattern</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The default heading is "Related links"
        <ul>
          <li>use more specific headings where possible to provide stronger context for a person</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Do not add borders to this block
        <ul>
          <li>the aim is to reduce visual noise and avoid "banner blindness" (where people automatically interpret content in boxes as ads)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Use standard link styles</li>
      <li>Use bullets, not numbered lists</li>
    </ul>
