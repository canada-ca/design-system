title: Related links design pattern
---


<div>
 
 <section>
  <p>
   The related links pattern is a list of links to content that is related to the page on which it appears
  </p>
  <section>
   <h2>
    When to use this pattern
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Use this pattern to provide links to content that is directly relevant to the content on the current page
    </li>
    <li>
     Do not use the related links pattern when a personâ€™s flow must not be interrupted such as in a transactional process
    </li>
   </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
   <h2>
    How to use this pattern
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Position the list of links after the main content of the page, but before the footer section
     <ul>
      <li>
       a consistent location at the bottom of the content area helps a person recognize the function of this pattern
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
     The default heading is "Related links"
     <ul>
      <li>
       use more specific headings where possible to provide stronger context for a person
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
     Do not add borders to this block
     <ul>
      <li>
       the aim is to reduce visual noise and avoid "banner blindness" (where people automatically interpret content in boxes as ads)
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
     Use standard link styles
    </li>
    <li>
     Use bullets, not numbered lists
    </li>
   </ul>
