  Alerts are short, prominent notices meant to draw attention to an important message or change. They are often time-sensitive. The label, colour, and icon indicate the type of message and its urgency.

  <h2 id="when">
   When to use
  </h2>
  <p>
   Use contextual alerts to:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    bring a personâ€™s attention to an important change at the page or subsection level like a service or site outage
   </li>
   <li>
    draw attention to important recent or upcoming changes to a process or service
   </li>
   <li>
    provide the result of a user-action, for example, confirm success, or notify a person of an error
   </li>
   <li>
    warn a person of a consequence of an action or inaction related to their task
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   To use contextual alerts during urgent service disruptions, follow these guidelines:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <a href="../crisis/alerts.html">
     Canada.ca alerts and service disruptions
    </a>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </section>
 <section>
  <h2 id="avoid">
   What to avoid
  </h2>
  <p>
   Do not use contextual alerts:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    to provide information about a normal step in a process or task
   </li>
   <li>
    to simply add emphasis to content
   </li>
   <li>
    in cases where a warning is neither high risk nor frequently experienced
   </li>
   <li>
    to create labels, use this component instead:
    <ul>
     <li>

  <h2 id="how">
   How to implement
  </h2>
  <p>
   Write alert text for a grade 6 to 8 reading level.
  </p>
  <p>
   Keep alert text very brief. Provide further details in the appropriate section or page.
  </p>
  <p>
   Remove alert text once the issue is resolved or enough time has passed that the information provided is no longer new.
  </p>
  <p>
   Strictly limit the number of alerts on the page to avoid alert fatigue.
  </p>
  <p>
   Place the alert in the appropriate context:
  </p>
  <dl class="dl-horizontal">
   <dt>
    Applies to the entire site
   </dt>
   <dd>
    Place it at the top of the page above the main heading
   </dd>
   <dt>
    Applies to the page
   </dt>
   <dd>
    Place it underneath the page heading
   </dd>
   <dt>
    Applies to a subsection of the page
   </dt>
   <dd>
    Place it within that subsection, generally underneath the subsection heading or between 2 paragraphs
   </dd>
  </dl>
  <p>
   Use the appropriate type of alert:
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    <a href="#danger">
     Danger alert
    </a>
   </li>
   <li>

   </li>
  </ol>
  <h3 id="danger">
   1. Danger alert
  </h3>
  <p>
   <strong>
    When to use:
   </strong>
   Use the danger alert to draw attention to a situation that could place someone in danger, such as a do not travel warning. You can also use it to alert a person of a technical issue that could cause them to be unable to complete their task, such as an invalid submission of data in a form.
