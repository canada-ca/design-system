title: Charts and graphs design pattern
---


<div>
 
 <section>
  <p>
   Charts and graphs are visualization techniques for communicating data or statistics.
  </p>
  <section>
   <h2>
    When to use this pattern
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Use charts and graphs to communicate data more efficiently than in text or tables, when there are multiple data points to be presented
    </li>
    <li>
     Do not use charts and graphs when the data set is simple enough to be presented as a table, such as when there are few data points
    </li>
   </ul>
  </section>

   <h2>
    How to use this pattern
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Where possible, use
     <abbr title="Web Experience Toolkit">
      WET
     </abbr>
     4 charts and graphs, rather than flat images
    </li>
    <li>
     Always include data points as tabular data accompanying charts or graphs
     <ul>
      <li>
       it is recommended to provide an expandable table with tabular data immediately underneath the figure
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
     Size and place charts and graphs appropriately for the context they are in
     <ul>
      <li>
       they must appear connected to the related content
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
     Do not place charts and graphs in line with text blocks such as in a paragraph; rather, place them in between text blocks
    </li>
    <li>
     Maximize available space to enhance readability
    </li>
    <li>
     Keep charts and graphs as simple as possible
    </li>
   </ul>
