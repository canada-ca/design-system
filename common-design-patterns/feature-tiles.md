   Context-specific features  are in-page components used to promote government activities, initiatives,  programs and services.
  </p>
  <section>
   <h2>
    When to use this pattern
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Use this component to promote government activities, initiatives, programs and services that       are relevant to the page on which they appear
    </li>
    <li>
     Do not use this component to promote activities and       initiatives that are not relevant to their context
    </li>
    <li>
     Do not use this component when a person's flow must not be       interrupted, as in a transactional process
    </li>
    <li>
     Do not duplicate content or links from other components on       the page
    </li>
   </ul>

   <h2>
    How to use this pattern
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Context-specific features always comprise a link and an       image, with optional header and description text
    </li>
    <li>
     On navigation templates (such as theme or topic pages), use 2 or 3 features side-by-side, with each link placed above the image and the description placed underneath the image
    </li>
    <li>
     On destination templates (such as generic pages), limit use       to a single feature with the image placed to the left of the link and       description
    </li>
    <li>
     On navigation  pages, always use a header. The default wording for this block is “Features.”  Use more specific headings where possible to provide stronger context for a person
    </li>
    <li>
     On destination pages, use of a header is optional. When using       a header, always use a specific wording to provide context
    </li>
    <li>
     Position context-specific features   after the main content of the page, but before the footer section
    </li>
    <li>
     Use a maximum of 40 characters for the hyperlink text
    </li>
    <li>
     When applying images in contextual features, follow specifications in the
     <a href="images.html">
      images pattern
     </a>
    </li>
    <li>
     Keep the description text short and concise
     <ul>
      <li>
       1 or 2 lines is ideal
      </li>
      <li>
       do not exceed 3 lines of text (which works out to approximately 145 characters with spaces)
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
     The description link text and  header must be different
     <ul>
      <li>
       do not repeat multi-word phrases in any of the header,        link or description text
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
     Use the defined presentation classes included in the Canada.ca
     <abbr title="Web Experience Toolkit">
      WET
     </abbr>
     theme
    </li>
    <li>
