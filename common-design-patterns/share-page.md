     How to implement Share this page
    </h2>
    <ul>
     <li>
      The component is presented as a button using
      <abbr title="Web Experience Toolkit">
       WET
      </abbr>
      style for
				secondary actions
     </li>
     <li>
      The label reads: “Share this page”, preceded by the sharing icon in the defined icon set included in
      <abbr title="Web Experience Toolkit">
       WET
      </abbr>
     </li>
     <li>
      Placement: positioned below the main content area, right-alignwed.
     </li>
     <li>
      When clicked, a dismissible overlay is triggered:
      <ul>
       <li>
        the overlay is labeled “Share this page” and includes buttons for a selection of sharing platforms and
						delivery services, and the message “No endorsement of any products or services is expressed or implied.”
       </li>
       <li>
        on large screens, the buttons appear in 2 columns
       </li>
       <li>
        on small screens, a person is presented with a single column of buttons
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
      Within the overlay, the button for each sharing platform or delivery service uses
      <abbr title="Web Experience Toolkit">
       WET
      </abbr>
      style for secondary actions
     </li>
     <li>
      The label for each button within the overlay includes the name of the sharing platform or delivery service,
				preceded by a relevant logo or icon
     </li>
     <li>
      When clicked, each button within the overlay triggers a link to that platform or service, including
				appropriate parameters, such as the URL or title of the page being shared
      <ul>
       <li>
        these links open in new browser tabs or windows where feasible
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
    </ul>
