  </h2>
  <ul>
   <li>

   </li>
   <li>
    Only use this component on navigation or landing pages; do not use with destination content
   </li>
   <li>
    Do not use this component when a person’s flow must not be interrupted, as in a transactional process
   </li>
   <li>
    Do not duplicate content from other promotional components on the page
   </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>
   How to use this pattern
  </h2>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Promotional feature banners are full-width, narrow-height components that comprise text, imagery, and links
   </li>
   <li>
    A maximum of 65 characters is allowed for all text (including link label)
   </li>
   <li>
    Both text and imagery must be linked, but all links in the feature banner must point to the same destination; alternatively, the entire container must operate as a single linked area
   </li>
   <li>
    Textual elements must be coded as HTML text—do not embed text into imagery
   </li>
   <li>
    To ensure responsiveness at varying screen sizes, do not use a single static image for this component
   </li>
   <li>
    Use the defined presentation classes included in the Canada.ca
    <abbr title="Web Experience Toolkit">
     WET
    </abbr>
    theme
   </li>
   <li>
