   Multimedia is time-based media of a visual or auditory nature that complements or enhances text, including video clips and audio recordings.
  </p>
  <section>
   <h2>
    When to use this pattern
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Avoid unnecessary decoration on Canada.ca – only use multimedia content when it provides more information than can be provided through text alone
    </li>
    <li>
     Refer to the
     <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/government-communications/canada-content-style-guide.html#wp6-4">
      Canada.ca Content Style Guide for details on when to use video or audio multimedia content

   <h2>
    How to use this pattern
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Size and place multimedia appropriately for the context it is in. Embedded multimedia must appear connected to the content, and complement it
    </li>
    <li>
     Do not place multimedia in line with text blocks, for example within a paragraph; place them in between text blocks instead
    </li>
    <li>
     Where multimedia includes people, it should reflect Canada’s diverse population
    </li>
    <li>
     Embedded multimedia must appear square or rectangular
    </li>
    <li>
     Use only the
     <abbr title="Web Experience Toolkit">
      WET
     </abbr>
     multimedia player, which provides accessible playback controls
    </li>
    <li>
     Always include descriptive transcripts accompanying multimedia content – place the link to the transcript immediately under the multimedia
    </li>
    <li>
     The link must point to a separate page for longer transcripts or open a details-summary element for shorter transcripts
    </li>
    <li>
     Where additional captions and attributions are required, place them immediately under the link to the transcript for the multimedia that they refer to
    </li>
    <li>
     Align links, captions or attributions with the left edge of the embedded multimedia that they refer to
    </li>
    <li>
     Avoid using multimedia from sources outside the Government of Canada
    </li>
   </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
   <h2>
    Licensing
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Institutions are responsible for the proper use of multimedia purchased through a licensing agreement
    </li>
    <li>
     If the multimedia is licensed only to one institution, it can only be used by that institution on Canada.ca
    </li>
    <li>
     Read the licensing agreement carefully for any other restrictions on the use of purchased multimedia
    </li>
    <li>
     Verify that you have the appropriate rights to publish multimedia on Canada.ca, specifically:
     <ul>
      <li>
       get a signed release from a person (or legal guardian) before you publish any representation of him or her
      </li>
      <li>
       have documentation showing you have the appropriate rights to publish licensed (or rights-managed) multimedia
      </li>
     </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
     Multimedia that is no longer licensed for use by an institution must be removed from Canada.ca
    </li>
   </ul>

    Shorter transcripts should be placed on the same page following the player, while longer transcripts can be hidden inside a details/summary element or placed on a separate page.
