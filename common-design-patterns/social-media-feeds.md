  <h2>Decommissioning</h2>
  <p>We’re decommissioning this pattern and don’t recommend using it on your pages. For questions related to this pattern, <a href="mailto:cds.dto-btn.snc@servicecanada.gc.ca">contact the Canada.ca Experience Office.</a></p>
</section>

<p>The social media feeds widget is an in-page component that allows the latest posts from official Government of Canada social media accounts to be embedded on Canada.ca pages</p>
<section>
  <h2>When to use this pattern</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the social media feeds widget on pages where official <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr>  social media accounts are relevant to the current context</li>
    <li>Do not use this component when a person’s flow must not be interrupted, as in a transactional process</li>
    <li>Do not duplicate content from other promotional components on the page</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>How to use this pattern</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The social media feeds widget consists of a heading with panels for up to 3 social media accounts, each featuring a feed of recent posts</li>
    <li>The default heading for this widget is “Stay connected”</li>
    <li>Each feed panel includes
      <ul>
        <li>a heading that indicates which social media platform the account’s feed is drawn from, for example Facebook or YouTube</li>
        <li>a feed of the recent posts from that account, arranged in reverse chronological order</li>
        <li>the 3 most recent posts as the default setting, with a link to the account from which the feed is drawn to allow people to see more</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Use the defined presentation classes included in the Canada.ca <abbr title="Web Experience Toolkit">WET</abbr> theme</li>
  </ul>
