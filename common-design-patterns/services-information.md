   Services and information is a pattern for presenting sets of links with accompanying descriptions (also known as doormat). Each link with its description provides an accurate and concise description of what a person will find on the destination page. Together, these sets of links and descriptions provide clear and distinct choices for people trying to complete their task.

   <h2>
    When to use this pattern
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Use this pattern to provide links to topics or destination content related to the page it is on
    </li>
    <li>
     Use when the primary purpose of the page is to provide clear choices to navigate to tasks
    </li>
   </ul>

    How to use this pattern
   </h2>
   <section>
    <h3>
     Content requirements
    </h3>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Content for each link and description pairing is written for a grade 6-8 reading level
     </li>
     <li>
      Keep punctuation simple
     </li>
     <li>
      Use popular keywords that the target audience will likely know and use; base choices on research and evidence
     </li>
     <li>
      Don’t use acronyms or abbreviations unless most people know these better than the long-form equivalent
     </li>
     <li>
      See the
      <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/government-communications/canada-content-style-guide.html">
       Canada.ca Content Style Guide
      </a>
      for more information on how to write content for this pattern
     </li>
    </ul>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h3>
     Link requirements
    </h3>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Link text must make sense within the context of the page
      <ul>
       <li>
        It does not need to exactly match the destination page title
       </li>
       <li>
        It does not need to be unique across Canada.ca
       </li>
       <li>
        It must be descriptive, unique within the page, and clearly distinguishable from the other links on the page
       </li>
       <li>
        Don’t end linked text with punctuation (for example, “How do you apply for funding?”)
       </li>
       <li>
        The linked text must speak to a person (for example, “Apply for funding”)
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
      The optimal character limit for links is 45 characters (with spaces) for both official languages, but can extend to 75 characters (with spaces)
     </li>
     <li>
      Use only standard link styles as defined in the Web Experience Toolkit (WET)
     </li>
    </ul>
   </section>
   <section>
    <h3>
     Link descriptions
    </h3>
    <ul>
     <li>
      The link description complements the link it accompanies to provide greater detail and clarity about the scope of the link itself
      <ul>
       <li>
        Recommended style is to list keywords or keyword phrases separated by commas; full sentences are not required
       </li>
       <li>
        Don’t use introductory phrases such as “Includes…”, “Information on…” or “Learn more about…”
       </li>
       <li>
        Don’t include links
       </li>
       <li>
        Don’t include promotional messaging
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
      The character limit for link descriptions is 120 characters (with spaces) in both official languages
     </li>
     <li>
      Drop-down menus are permitted in place of a link description in specific circumstances:
      <ul>
       <li>
        When used to provide access to a large number of items at the same level (for example, lists of countries or species)
       </li>
       <li>
        When the destination page consists primarily of a list of links, and so can be completely replaced by the drop-down menu
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
      Use only standard presentation styles as defined in
      <abbr title="Web Experience Toolkit">
       WET
      </abbr>
     </li>
    </ul>
   </section>

    <h3>
     Grouping sets of links with accompanying descriptions
    </h3>
    <p>
     The following styles may be used:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Demand-based
      <ul>
       <li>
        Prioritization is based on demand (for example, based on web metrics), with higher demand links appearing ahead of lower demand ones
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
      Sequential
      <ul>
       <li>
        Use sequential, numbered doormats when links must be followed in a step-by-step order (for example, confirming eligibility, registering and then charging for GST/HST)
       </li>
       <li>
        Use to allow people to skip over optional/non-applicable steps or steps they have previously completed
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
      Subheadings
      <ul>
       <li>
        Use to group links and descriptions that are very similar, in cases where it wouldn’t make sense to move the group into a sub-topic page
       </li>
       <li>
        Use to avoid information overload; ideally no more than 9 links with descriptions per subheading
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
      Combinations of the above, as appropriate; however, limit application to avoid overly complex sets of links and descriptions
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     In all cases, priority sequencing is as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      In a single column layout, the priority sequencing is top to bottom
     </li>
     <li>
      In using across multiple columns, the priority sequencing is from left to right, then top to bottom
     </li>
    </ul>
