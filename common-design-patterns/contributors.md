    <h3>Content specifications</h3>
    <p>The link to the institution or organization is introduced by the word "From:"</p>
    <p>List supporting institutions or organizations. Links must point to the organization’s main landing page. Where possible, use:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            institutional landing page
        </li>
        <li>
            partnering/collaborative arrangement profile page
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The link label must be the same as the name that appears on the page it is linking to.</p>
    <h3>Design specifications</h3>
    <p>This pattern should be positioned below all content on the page, but above the date modified field.</p>
    <p>Do not place this block in line with other text blocks or layout elements; it stands alone.</p>
    <p>Left-align the heading and the links.</p>
    <p>Use standard paragraph, heading and link <a href="https://design.canada.ca/styles/colours.html">colours</a>.</p>
    <p>The heading is an H2 styled at font-size: 87% (or 17px).</p>
    <p>The list items are bolded and sized at font-size: 87% (or 17px).</p>
    <p>The links are to the right of the H2 and are coded in a horizontal list. The first item in the list is unstyled (no bullet).</p>
    <h3>Visual example</h3>
    <div class="pattern-demo mrgn-tp-md mrgn-bttm-md">
        <figure class="mrgn-tp-md mrgn-bttm-lg">
            <figcaption><b>Contributors pattern</b></figcaption>
            <img src="../images/contributors.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Contributors pattern. Text version below:" />
            <details>
                <summary>Image description: contributors</summary>
                <p>
                    The heading “From;” is aligned to the left. Two placeholder links appear in a list, aligned horizontally with the heading. The placeholder link text is [Department or agency 1]. This is followed by a bullet and then
                    another placeholder link labeled [Department or agency 2]
