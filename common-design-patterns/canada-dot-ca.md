   When to use
  </h2>
  <p>
   Use the Canada.ca domain for all public-facing Government of Canada web pages, to ensure consistency and enhance trust. This includes websites or services that are intended for people outside government but require a login to access.
  </p>
  <p>
   Two approaches can be used:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    with no subdomain, such as
    <a href="https://canada.ca/en/services/jobs.html">
     https://canada.ca/en/services/jobs.html
    </a>
   </li>
   <li>
    with a subdomain, such as
    <a href="https://tc.canada.ca/en/aviation">
     https://tc.canada.ca/en/aviation
    </a>
   </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
   Do not use the Canada.ca domain for collaborative sites where the Government of Canada is not the main partner.
