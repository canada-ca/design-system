# Canada.ca design library - evidence-based patterns &amp; templates

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/canada-ca/design-system.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/canada-ca/design-system)

In order to move towards a more flexible design system, the plan is to “decouple” the detailed specs of the templates and patterns from the official “policy documents” - the [Canada.ca Content and Information Architecture Specification](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/government-communications/canada-content-information-architecture-specification.html) and [Canada.ca Content Style Guide](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/government-communications/canada-content-style-guide.html).

The vision would then be to gradually improve each pattern and template and make into usable code (rather than pictures) with instructions. We could also have a separate library of [“experimental patterns and templates”](https://github.com/canada-ca/design-system-systeme-conception), that we could open up to the whole community. We would need to eventually develop a process involving the community for a pattern to go from “experimental” to “approved”.
