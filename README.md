# Canada.ca design library - evidence-based patterns &amp; templates

In order to move towards a more flexible design system, the plan is to “decouple” the detailed specs of the templates and patterns from the official “policy documents” - the [Canada.ca Content and Information Architecture Specification](https://design.canada.ca/architecture/canada-content-information-architecture-specification.html) and [Canada.ca Content Style Guide](https://design.canada.ca/style-guide/).

The vision would then be to gradually improve each pattern and template and make into usable code (rather than pictures) with instructions. We could also have a separate library of “experimental patterns and templates”, that we could open up to the whole community. We would need to eventually develop a process involving the community for a pattern to go from “experimental” to “approved”.
