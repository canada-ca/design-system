<h2>Task scenarios tested and improved</h2>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
  <li>Your friend just completed a degree in translation and is considering joining the government. What's the salary of a level 1 translator in the government?</li>
  <li>Pat starts as a public servant on Monday, December 2nd. He needs to know when he will get his first paycheque, assuming his department does everything correctly.</li>
  <li>Alice accepted a 3-month acting position at Health Canada, starting in February. She wants to help her manager make sure her pay is accurate when she starts. When should her manager submit the paperwork?</li>
  <li>You have gone on parental leave and need to check your pay stub deductions from home. Find a way to do this.</li>
  <li>Avery took a 3-month leave without pay for school and is returning to work at Health Canada next month. She wants to help her manager ensure she starts getting paid as soon as possible. When should her manager submit the paperwork?</li>
  <li>You switched banks and want your next pay to be deposited in the new account. Which of the options below would you choose: What form or forms should be submitted? Where would you submit the change?</li>
  <li>Pat started work this year. Find a way for Pat to view her pay stub to check the deductions.</li>
  <li>Sam works at Statistics Canada. It's payday, but he didn't get any pay. What steps should Sam take?</li>
  <li>It turns out you had an overpayment of
    $500 on 4 pays last year. You've since bought a new house and finances are tight. Is it possible to arrange your own repayment schedule?</li>
  <li>Your pay last year was correct. You got two T4 tax slips thoughâ€”an incorrect one then a correct one in mid-February. You hired a tax advisor to help sort out your taxes. Without contacting anyone, find out if it's possible to get reimbursed for that tax advisor expense.</li>
