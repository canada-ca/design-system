<p>Help Health Canada prepare for the implementation of a transformed Recalls and Safety Alerts Management System (RSAMS) with a new search interface so that Canadians can find and understand both recalls and safety alerts.</p>
<h2>Partner departments</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Health Canada</li>
  <li>Transport Canada</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why this work matters</h2>
<ul>
  <li>the federal government is the largest public buyer of goods and services in Canada, with purchases of approximately $23 billion annually</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall task performance</h2>
<p>Functionality in the prototype was evolving as testing began, and some features were only available later in the testing. For this reason, the total number of recorded performances did not meet the minimum threshold for reliable comparison.</p>
<h2>Task scenarios tested</h2>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
  <li>Your son is allergic to eggs. He had a reaction tonight. Find out if each of these foods might have caused his allergic reaction.</li>
  <li>You saw something on Facebook about pastrami recalls. When you check in your fridge, you see you have a package with this tag on it. Are you risking illness if you eat it, or not?</li>
  <li>You heard on the news that there have been issues with E. coli in raw beef. You have a boneless blade roast in your freezer, purchased from Metzger Meats. What do you need to know to determine if it is safe to eat?</li>
  <li>Your sister gave you a 2015 Britax B-SAFE 35 baby car seat. Is there anything you or your sister should do before you use it?</li>
  <li>Your daughter carries an EpiPen in case of severe allergic reactions. Her EpiPen is going to expire soon. You heard there have been production problems, and want to confirm that you can get a replacement. Will you be able to?</li>
  <li>You are looking at buying a 2003 Honda Pilot SUV. Find out if there are any recalls for it before you buy it.</li>
  <li>You bought this USB charger at a gas station. When you plugged it in, it gave you an electric shock. You want to find out if Health Canada has issued a warning about this device.</li>
  <li>There are recalls right now for children's toys that people might have bought. Find and provide the name of the recalled toy that is of the most concern to you.</li>
  <li>Your daughter is allergic to peanuts. She had a reaction this afternoon at home. She ate only these two foods. Check if either was the cause.</li>
  <li>You are looking at this bluetooth speaker on eBay. Check if there are any problems with it. Is there a specific detail you should ask the seller about?</li>
</ul>
