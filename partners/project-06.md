  <li>Exactly which day in December will your Canada Child Benefit payment be deposited?</li>
  <li>Peter's kids are living with his ex. They will start coming to stay with Peter for 2 weekends per month. Should he apply for the Canada Child Benefit?</li>

  <li>If you were separated and sharing custody, could the two of you choose what percentage of the Canada Child Benefit each of you will get?</li>
  <li>Petra's July Child Benefit payment arrived and it is much less than she received in June. What is the most likely reason for this change?</li>
  <li>Petra didn't work last year while she finished school. What is the one official thing she must do every year in order to keep getting Canada Child Benefit payments for her daughter?</li>
  <li>Does it take longer to get your first Canada Child Benefit payment if you apply by mail than if you register/use My Account and apply online?</li>
  <li>Is it safe to close your old bank account before your June 20 Child Benefit payment? You changed your direct deposit to a new bank account number on June 5.</li>
