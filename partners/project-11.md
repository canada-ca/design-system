<ul class="lst-spcd">
  <li>Can an apprentice get a loan from the Canadian government to help during their apprenticeship?</li>
  <li>Can you get a grant from the Government of Canada to attend university part time?</li>
  <li>Your niece lives in New Brunswick will start university soon. She is from a low-income family and wants to apply for a student loan and a grant. Does she need to submit 2 separate applications?</li>
  <li>How would you update your bank account details to receive your student loan?</li>
  <li>Does the government offer a way to help you repay your student loans if your income drops?</li>
  <li>How soon after graduating do you have to start paying back your student loan from the government of Canada?</li>
  <li>You have been making student loan payments for the last 3 years but your financial situation is now very bad. Can your student loans be cleared if you file for bankruptcy?</li>
  <li>You graduated and earned some extra money at work. Is it possible to apply that money to your student loan outside of your regular monthly payments?</li>
  <li>You are having trouble making your loan payments despite still living with your parents in Manitoba. Who would you contact to discuss your situation and find out if you can get help repaying?</li>
