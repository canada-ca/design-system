<h2>Task scenarios tested and improved</h2>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
  <li>What will the weather be like in your area for the rest of the day?</li>
  <li>You heard there is rain coming but you want to cycle to/home from work. Find out when the probability of rain is the highest so you can avoid those times.</li>
  <li>It's Sunday morning, and you need to drive to Kingston for a Monday noon meeting. Should you leave this evening, or tomorrow morning?</li>
  <li>Hail would rip holes in your expensive tent. Should you rush to pack up your camp site this morning or take your time this evening?</li>
  <li>You want to take the the dog for a short walk before it rains. It is already raining anywhere in the Ottawa area yet (yes/no)?</li>
  <li>You are coaching children's soccer tonight. You have to cancel if the humidex is above 40 degrees. Should you cancel the game or not?</li>
  <li>You are the golf course manager: the sky looks dark. Find out (yes/no) whether you should clear the course because of the potential of lightning in the next 10-20 minutes.</li>
</ul>
