<h2>Task scenarios tested and improved</h2>
<ul class="lst-spcd">
  <li>Darren has been working full-time and making Employment Insurance contributions for 5 months. Is that enough for him to qualify for government support to take time off work to look after his sick 8-year-old son?</li>
  <li>What information would Chen need from his employer to support an application to take time off from work to look after his sick wife?</li>
  <li>Tara has applied for government support to take time off work to look after her sick 12-year-old daughter. When will she receive her first payment?</li>
  <li>Could you show me how you would apply for government help to take time off work to look after a sick parent?</li>
  <li>Omar is receiving government support to take time off work and look after an aunt who is ill. The relative's illness has suddenly become much worse, and she may not survive it. Omar has heard there is separate support to care for someone who may be near death. When can he apply for this?</li>
  <li>John's 6-year-old daughter is ill. How does John show that she is sick enough for him to qualify for government support to look after her?</li>
  <li>Irinaâ€™s father has fallen seriously ill. Her best friend Jane will take time off work to look after him. As Jane is not a member of the family, what will Irina need to do to support Jane's application?</li>
