<h2>Task scenarios tested and improved</h2>
<ul class="custul">
  <li class="custli">You want to register for a business number by mail. What is the number of the form you will need to send?</li>
  <li class="custli">You just registered your business, a sole proprietorship, with the government of Nova Scotia, and you received a business number. Find out if you need a federal business number, too.</li>
  <li class="custli">You are thinking of becoming an Uber driver to earn extra income while you are in school. You have been told that Uber drivers must collect and remit sales tax, and that you will need to register for a Goods and Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax (GST/HST) account. Do you need to know the amount of your annual sales when you register online?</li>
  <li class="custli">You have recently registered online for a GST/HST program account from the federal government. What information will you receive to confirm your registration is complete?</li>
  <li class="custli">You have been making maple syrup and selling it locally for a few years. You have never needed to register with the Canada Revenue Agency before, but you are now thinking of selling it online to customers in the United States. Do you need to register with the Canada Revenue Agency first? Find out if you need to register a business number to export goods sell your syrup in the US?</li>
  <li class="custli">You need to update your business address with the CRA. Please show me where you would go to update your address information online.</li>
  <li class="custli">You have been offered a full-time job, and won't be earning business income for a period of time. You want to keep your business active for use in the future. What do you need to do to keep your GST/HST account active?</li>
  <li class="custli">You operate a business in Penticton, B.C., and you need to send some documents to the CRA tax centre that is processing your business return. Find the mailing address you should use.</li>
