<h1 property="name headline" id="wb-cont" dir="ltr">Working with partners to improve task success on Canada.ca</h1>
<p>The Digital Transformation Office works with federal institutions to make Canada.ca content easier to find and understand.</p>
<p>Our method includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>setting concrete usability targets</li>
  <li>usability testing on specific Government of Canada Services</li>
  <li>co-creating prototypes</li>
</ul>
<p>We work collaboratively to refine prototypes until they achieve at least a 20% improvement in task success.  This standard for improvement means people will spend less time looking for the answers they need from the Government of Canada.</p>
