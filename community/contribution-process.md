<p>
 The GC design system needs to be constantly improving. The goal of this framework is to foster continuous improvement of the guidance through experimentation. It creates a space for departments to experiment and innovate, and contribute their findings for the benefit of the whole GC web community.

 Identify: submit a proposal for improvement
</h2>

<p>
 While designing content for Canadians or while testing your current design, you may determine that either:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  an existing component, pattern or template needs to be improved
 </li>
 <li>
  a new component, pattern or template is needed to fill a gap in the design system
 </li>
</ul>

<h3>
 Consult the backlog and the experiments in progress
</h3>

<p>
 The first step is to find out if the improvement has already been identified. To do so, consult the backlog:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/design-system-systeme-conception/projects/1">
   Backlog
  </a>
 </li>
</ul>

<h3>
 If your suggestion is not already identified
</h3>

<p>
 If the pattern or template you identified for improvement is not in the backlog, you can submit a proposal by opening an
 <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/design-system-systeme-conception/issues">
  issue in GitHub
 </a>
 .
</p>

<p>
 The proposal must include at least:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  a description of the issue or gap identified
 </li>
 <li>
  a hypothesis on how to fix it
 </li>
</ul>

<p>
 Suggestions will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by the community.
</p>

<h2 id="design">
 Design: from prototype to stable
</h2>

<p>
 Once an idea has been identified, anybody can work on tackling the issue.
</p>

<h3>
 Initial design and prototype
</h3>

<p>
 As soon as some form of prototype exists, it can be moved from the "to do" column to the the backlog to the "Design and prototyping" column in the
 <a href="https://github.com/canada-ca/design-system-systeme-conception/projects/1">
  backlog
 </a>
 project board.
</p>

<p>
 Update the corresponding issue in GitHub to share the prototype with the community.
</p>

<h3>
 Alpha
</h3>

<p>
 To go from early prototype to Alpha, the prototype needs to be accompanied with documentation that includes at the minimum:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  a hypothesis of how to solve the issue
 </li>
 <li>
  a mock-up or a coded prototype
 </li>
</ul>

<p>
 The Alpha phase is used to test the hypothesis, conduct research, deal with accessibility considerations, and code a working example for testing.
</p>

<h3>
 Beta
</h3>

<p>
 To go from Alpha to Beta, you need the following:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  a fully working coded example
 </li>
 <li>
  any CSS/JS overrides needed to implement in the latest WET theme for Canada.ca
 </li>
 <li>
  assessment of accessibility
 </li>
 <li>
  rationale for design choices - this can be results from research or a strong rationale
 </li>
 <li>
  some guidance on "When to use" this component, pattern or template
 </li>
 <li>
  documentation in both official languages
 </li>
</ul>

<p>
 Use the Beta phase to scale up the experiment and fix any issues you encounter.
</p>

<p>
 Beta updates are available through the main
 <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/government/about/design-system/pattern-library.html">
  design system library
 </a>
 , and departments can use them, as long as they consider it an experiment and are willing to report back on findings.
</p>

<h3>
 Stable
</h3>

<p>
 To go from Beta to Stable, the following must be done:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  integrated to core framework (WET)
 </li>
 <li>
  completely valid code
 </li>
 <li>
  no accessibility issues left unresolved
 </li>
 <li>
  comments from the community have been resolved
 </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="iterate">
 Iterate: back to the drawing board
</h2>

<p>
 Once a new or updated pattern has moved to stable, it becomes the new baseline guidance.
</p>

<p>
 But it doesn't mean that it's now perfect. If this improvement hasnâ€™t solved all the issues, or if new issues arise, the component, pattern or template can be added back to the backlog and be the subject of another design round.
