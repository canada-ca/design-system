  Community principles
 </h2>
 <p>
  Follow these principles when you contribute to the Canada.ca design system. These principles are heavily inspired by the GOV.UK design system community principles.
 </p>
 <h3>
  1. Start with what already exists
 </h3>
 <p>
  Start with the current library. There already may be something you can use, or something you can improve upon.
 </p>
 <p>
  The existing components, patterns and layouts are evidence-based, and they are a great starting point. Know what's there to identify gaps and possible improvements.
 </p>
 <p>
  Look at the
  <a href="#backlog">
   community backlog
  </a>
  to see if your idea has already been identified.
 </p>
 <p>
  Reach out to community to find what others already have done.
 </p>
 <h3>
  2. Share your learnings with the community
 </h3>
 <p>
  As you do research, share your findings with the whole community.
 </p>
 <p>
  Try to contribute back design components and patterns that are scalable, reusable and can evolve over time.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you find something that doesn't work (a gap, an error, a contradiction, a flawed design), speak up. Let the community know.
 </p>
 <p>
  When working on a contribution, gather evidence, and share it.
 </p>
 <h3>
  3. Work in the open, and be open
 </h3>
 <p>
  To avoid duplication of effort, when you are working on something, let the community know.
 </p>
 <p>
  Share your work as early as possible, so others can contribute too.
 </p>
 <p>
  Be honest and humble: share what works, what doesn't, and the research you did to understand that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Be kind and respectful, and be open to feedback and changes to your work.
 </p>
 <p>
  Be inclusive from the get go, and value what others can bring.
