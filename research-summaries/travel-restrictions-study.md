title: "Using a wizard to help people get answers about changing entry requirements during COVID-19"

<p>For Canadians and those hoping to visit or immigrate to Canada during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, travel restrictions were complex and constantly changing. Finding answers about travel was one of the top COVID-19 tasks visitors were attempting to complete online. Although lots of information was available on Canada.ca, finding the right information and synthesizing it into clear answers was difficult for individual travelers. Travel, transport, and immigration are handled by multiple departments, which complicates the task of finding all the information relevant to oneâ€™s own particular situation and travel plans.</p>
<p>We conducted usability testing with potential travelers and found that synthesizing complex travel information into an interactive wizard helped participants complete key tasks. A wizard is a way of guiding people to the answer they need through a series of interactive questions. Participants using the wizard arrived at the correct answer to questions about travel restrictions more often than participants who were constructing answers from information that is distributed across pages managed by different institutions.</p>
