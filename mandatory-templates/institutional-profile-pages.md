        <h3>Research findings</h3>
        <p>
            We validated the institutional landing page during two optimization projects with the Canada Revenue Agency. We found that this design was useful for providing access to the top tasks for an institution while also giving users
            access to corporate information about the organization.

        <h3>Policy rationale</h3>
        <p>This template is a mandatory element of the Content and Information Architecture Specification.</p>
