A Custom Task List is a list of tasks that can be used to get additional targeted data in the GC Task Success Survey.

## When to consider a custom task list

You may consider a custom task list if:

* you have a specific program, campaign, page, etc. that you want to have targeted survey responses for
* your institution requires more data
* the Canada.ca Task List (default) doesn’t meet your reporting needs

A Custom Task List includes the ability for branching (i.e. creating sub-tasks) to help organize your task list

## How to request a custom task list

1.  **Fill out the custom task list template**

## Guidance for completing the custom task list template

<ul class="list-unstyled">
    <li>
        <details>
            <summary>Contact information</summary>
            <h3>Institution Name (department, agency or organization)</h3>
            <p>Enter the name of your institution.</p>
            <h3>Contact details (name, email and telephone number)</h3>
            <p>Enter the contact details of the person who is best able to answer questions about the information you provided in this request.</p>
        </details>
    </li>
    <li>
        <details>
            <summary>Task IDs, branching and levels</summary>
            <h3>ID</h3>
            <p>Each task and sub-task should be entered on a separate line in the spreadsheet. Each line gets a unique ID: 1, 2, 3 etc…</p>
            <h3>Branching</h3>
            <p>Branching means that you are including a set of sub-tasks to a particular task. If you have a task that has important sub-tasks, indicate this with a « y » for yes, or an « n » for no.</p>
            <p>The survey can have up to two levels of tasks. This can help survey respondents find the specific task that they came to the site for if you have many tasks.</p>
            <p>For example, instead of listing tasks separately</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Apply for a passport</li>
                <li>Renew a passport</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You could use 2 levels of tasks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Passports (apply, renew)
                    <ul>
                        <li>Apply for a passport</li>
                        <li>Renew a passport</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Level</h3>
            <p>Tasks that appear on the first reason of visit question, should be given a « 1 » for the first level. Sub-tasks that are provided as options following the branching of the first question, should be given a “2” for the second level.</p>
            <h3>Parent ID</h3>
            <p>Sub-tasks that are provided as options following the branching of the first question, are given the ID number of its parent task. All other tasks should be given a “0”.</p>
            <h3>Branching Question EN</h3>
            <p>If you included a “y” in the Branching column for a task, you must include a branching question. We recommend using “What specifically were you trying to do or find?”. You can edit this text if it does not align with your sub-tasks.</p>
            <h3>Enchaînement de question FR</h3>
            <p>If you included a “y” in the Branching column for a task, you must include a branching question. We recommend using “Que tentiez-vous précisément d’accomplir ou de trouver ?”. You can edit this text if it does not align with your sub-tasks.</p>
