The survey is a collaboration between Principal Publisher and the Digital Transformation Office.

## Office hours

Book a timeslot where you can meet one-on-one with a subject matter expert to get answers to your questions.

Office Hours are a bi-weekly (every second Wednesday) virtual one-hour session from 1:00-2:00 PM where users can book 15-minute timeslots to meet one-on-one with a Subject Matter Expert (SME).

This time can be used to:

* ask questions
* get advice
* brainstorm next steps
* learn more about the inner workings of the survey


If we are unable to answer your question during the session, we will connect with other members of the team and get back to you via email.
