The survey is a collaboration between Principal Publisher and the Digital Transformation Office and is mandatory for all GC websites covered under FAA Schedules I, I.1 and II.

## Sample size

10% of visitors to the GC web presence are randomly invited to participate in the survey. If institutions require more responses, Principal Publisher can support by creating more invitations.

## Survey design

### Survey invitation

When visitors arrive on a webpage, a pop-up invites visitors at random to complete the survey at the end of their visit. If visitors select "Yes, after my visit" on the pop-up, the survey opens in a separate window or tab. Visitors are asked to return to that window or tab to complete the survey after they have finished their visit on the website.
